# Installation

Clone this repo to `~/linux_home` and then edit `install.sh` and run `install.sh`.

# Emacs

After installing the .emacs in this repo, you'll need to manually do `alt-x`, `package-install` then `use-package`.
Spelling: `sudo apt install aspell-en`
The `.emacs` in this repo already sets up Emacs to use aspell (instead of ispell).
